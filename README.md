Hershey Pond is a typeface originating from the early digital era, inspired by the work of Dr. Allen Vincent Hershey and custom-made for the event series Nocturnal Serenade. In the late 1960s, Dr. Hershey developed various vector-based typefaces for military aircraft displays in the United States. This remix of Hershey’s work evokes a sense of “froggyness.” The glyphs appear to leap or crouch — like a frog chorus — giving the text a kinetic, rhythmic feel. This typographic language bridges human code and amphibian voice, turning every word into a croaking, skittering performance across the surface.
